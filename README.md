This is a data analysis project about the classification of drug consumers in 2016 ( data : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29 )
<br /><br />
# Steps to analyse the Data :

- __Data Cleaning__ : search for missing Values, data imputation (Replacing the N/A the best way we can), incorrect types, incorrect or invalid values, drop outliners and non relevant data, statistical sanitization (delete duplicate rows for exemple)

- __Data Wrangling__ (in french 'Préparation de Données en Self-Service') : handling categorical data, reshaping and transforming structures, Indexing data, merging (joining) and combining data

- __Data Mining__ : searching for more data (by scrapping, consulting APIs etc) to enhance our dataset

- __Analysis__ : exploration, building statistical models, vizualisation and representations, correlation vs causation analysis, hypothesis testing, reporting

- __Action__ : Building ML models, building ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) pipelines, data-based decisions
